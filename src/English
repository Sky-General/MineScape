To kill a Mocking Bird
Civil War
by: Harper Lee

The American Civil War was fought between to American groups, the Union, and the Confederates, both fighting for State Rights, and whether or not to allow slavery.

When the war broke out, the Union had a government that was established in 1777, but the Confederacy’s government was only established in 1861. Because the Confederates’ government was so new, they had very little money, had very poor living conditions, and were less experienced. Even through all of the hardships they faced, the Confedorates were notorious for singing. Before 1862, most volunteers included bands, which marched with the soldiers, although, after 1862, most of the bands were dismissed, because there were not enough supplies to support them. A few bands did stay, and most joined bigger bands, with more soldiers. During the time, newspapers were becoming more and more popular. The soldiers would write to their local newspaper, so their families could watch their fortune on the field. The Confederacy’s currency had been loosing value throughout the war, and by the time the war was over, $1 Confederate money was about ¢5 in gold 1.
